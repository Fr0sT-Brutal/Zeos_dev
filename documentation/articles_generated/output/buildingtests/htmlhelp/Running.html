            As written in section "Compiling Tests", it is possible to execute special
            tests (e. g. only Bug Report Tests) by calling the EXE-file explicitly. Depending
            on the settings you will start one console application or one GUI application.
            You also may run all tests by running them sequentially via batch script (consider
              to compile all the tests as a console application!)
              
         </p>
         <p>
              Before you run tests make sure that all the database servers you want to test are
              up and running!
         </p>
         <p>
              To do run all tests (that are defined to run in section "tests" of the build.properties
              file), automatically, just type "test" from a commandline in "build" directory. The
              test result is output to screen and into a log file located in the "build"
              subdirectory "logs". The logfile is called "test-YYYYMMDD.log"  where "YYYYMMDD"
              is the current date.
