         <simpara>Even if ZConnection.SQLHourGlass is set to "true" the mousepointer looks like an arrow. This is no bug of Zeos. DBScreen is not nil when using the unit DB which is used by several units of zeos, BUT is is initialized with a class-object which is not changing the cursor, the user sees (Forms. Screen.Cursor). This Object is initialized in unit DBCtrls. If you want to see the SQLHourGlass then you should add the unit DBCtrls to your uses-clause. </simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
         <simpara>Error while saving date using ADO and MSSQL Server. If a date has to be stored having a day less then 13, then it will be stored changing day with month (see: http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;327579).</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
         <simpara>ADO (with MSAccess) returns smallInt instead of boolean type. This is the "normal" behaiviour of ADO. (Tested and approved with a TADODataSet and this also created a TSmallIntField).</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>SQLHourGlass is never shown. Cursor is initialized in unit DBCtrls. If you want to see the SQLHourGlass then you have to add the unit DBCtrls to the uses-clause.</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>RequestLive (since V 6.5.2 renamed to ReadOnly), CachedUpdates and UpdateObject are processed by ZeosDBO Query differently from standard TQuery. In ZeosDBO there is no correlation between them as it done in VCL. If your query is alive you must set RequestLive=true doesn&apos;t matter have you set CachedUpdates+UpdateObject or not. Otherwise, if RequestLive=false your query will be always read-only. UpdateObject can be used in non-cached mode as well as in cached mode.</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>Because of the limitations of dblibrary only the first 255 char is returned for char and varchar columns.</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>LargeInt fields are not completely supported in Delphi 4,5 and C++ Builder 4,5.</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>Sybase does not support procedure parameter type query. Though a workaround was possible for ASE12.5 and above.</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>Oracle provider for ADO is case sensitive for the table name when getting schema columns, the MS version is working right. Identifier convertion must be reviewed for ADO.</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>If you are using dbgrid, all the records will be fetched because of a call to recordcount (in scrollbar). You can avoid this behavior if you turn on the Filtered property. In this case you can achieve fast open even on bigger resultsets.</simpara>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<simpara>Midas <classname>IProviderSupport</classname> interface is not completely supported. It may cause problems with <classname>TDatasetProvider</classname> and <classname>TClientDataset</classname>. Full support for <classname>IProviderSupport</classname> interface will be added to version 6.2.</simpara>
