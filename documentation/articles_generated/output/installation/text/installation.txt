You can download the current (CVS) version from http://www.zeoslib.net


1. Unpack the archive to a folder

2. Copy the required dlls from lib directory to the windows system
   directory (usually Windows\System or winnt\system32)

3. Add the build Directory of the package you are about to install to
   Delphi's library path.

4. Locate the package directory associated with your compiler and open
   the ZeosDbo.bpg project group. Load the project and compile the
   following components in the order listed (or just choose compile all
   from Project-Menu):

   * ZCore.bpl
   * ZParseSql.bpl
   * ZPlain.bpl
   * ZDbc.bpl



5. If all the packages, listed above are successfully compiled you
   have to install the ZComponent.bpl. After that all ZEOS components are
   available in the IDE.

6. Create your own project and start adding the compoents through the
   IDE and set connection properties. For a quick tutorial, use the
   example provided with the project or browse the resources on the web
   page.




*Observations:*

1. When installing the library under C++ Builder (any version) it is
   highly recommended to remove any previously installed version of
   ZEOSDBO.

   To do that you should first close C++ Builder (as some of these files
   may be locked) and remove the
   (ZCore|ZParseSql|ZPlain|Zdbc|ZComponent)(.bpl|.tds|.bpi|.lib) files
   from $(BCB)\Projects\Lib and $(BCB)\Projects\Bpl (where $(BCB) is
   something like C:\Program Files\Borland\CBuilder[4-6]).

2. When compiling the library from ZeosDbo.bpg under C++ Builder you
   may receive some warnings like 'Unable to find package import XXX.bpi'
   and you may have to press Cancel multiple times to continue.

   We're trying to get rid of this annoying behaviour, but until then
   here are some possible ways to avoid it, if needed:

   1. Open, compile and install the packages (*.bpk) in the
      appropriate order (see Installation step #3) - i.e without using
      ZeosDbo.bpg.
   2. Open a command line in \packages\CBuilder[4-6] and do a
      manual make - like this: *make -f ZeosDbo.bpg*. This requires the
      PATH and LIB environment variables to be set properly, like this:
SET BCB=d:\borland\cbuilder6
SET PATH=%BCB%\bin
SET LIB=%BCB%\lib
      Then open ZeosDbo.bpg in the IDE and install the packages the usual
      way.




3. While installing ZEOSDBO under C++ Builder version 4 from the IDE,
   you may get this error when compiling the ZDbc package :
[Pascal Fatal Error] ZDbcMetadata.pas(3076): Internal error: SY876.
   Currently, there is no known solution to this problem. Therefore,it is
   recommended to compile Zeoslib from the command line (issuing a *make
   -f ZeosDBO.bpg* from the directory /packages/cbuilder4 should
   accomplish this) and then to install the packages through menu
   Component->Install Packages.
