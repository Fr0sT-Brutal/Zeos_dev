         <p>Direct access to SQL databases continues to be a vital technology even in today's enterprise environment. Thousands of two-tier
            client server applications are developed and maintained in the international business community. Most of them are built off
            of specially designed application programming interfaces (APIs) to retrieve relational data and execute SQL statements.
         </p>
         <p>Currently, there is several standardized and widely used APIs to access SQL databases, such as ODBC, JDBC, and ADO. Borland
            also released their proprietary database middleware interface for its development tools, called the Borland Database Engine
            (BDE). Despite being freely distributed with Borland's popular line of application development tools, the BDE was unpopular
            because of complexities in installation and poor performance. As Delphi became one of the leading application development
            tools for the Windows platform, individuals and companies proposed alternative interfaces to the BDE. These &#8220;<span class="quote">BDE Alternatives</span>&#8221; optimized access to the database by directly using the native database driver, providing performance and feature advantages
            with respect to the BDE.
         </p>
         <p>Realizing the limitations of the BDE, Borland proposed a new type of database interface called dbExpress. This interface was
            designed to broker access between Delphi and virtually any relational database through 3rd party drivers. Borland significantly
            improved the performance of dbExpress with respect to the BDE, but the implementation was buggy and supported only a limited
            subset of SQL that hampered functionality.
         </p>
         <p>The Zeos Database Object component library (ZeosLib) is one of the best-known BDE alternatives. Originally the library was
            developed for MySQL and PostgreSQL databases, but support for other vendors was soon added. During the development process,
            certain limitations of the original design became more and more apparent. These limitations began to put a strain on the overall
            architecture and the development team decided a ground up rewrite was the best way to proceed. The new design was built to
            handle an extended feature list with several new requirements:
